		<h1>REPORTS</h1>
		<br>
		<h2>These reports are generated using Oracle Report Builder.</h2>
		<h2>Oracle Reports Builder is the report-building component of Oracle Reports, a powerful enterprise reporting tool that enables you to rapidly develop and deploy sophisticated Web and paper reports against any data source(including an Oracle database, JDBC, XML, and text files). Oracle Reports Developer is a powerful, declarative WYSIWYG report design tool.</h2>
		<h2>Oracle Reports consists of Oracle Reports Developer (a component of the Oracle Developer Suite) and Oracle Reports Services (a component of Oracle Fusion Middleware). Oracle Reports Developer includes Oracle Reports Builder.</h2>
		<h2>A Report is a document containing information organized in a narrative, graphic, or tabular form. Reports are used for keeping track of information, which may be used to make decisions. Reports are used in government, business, education, science, and other fields, are often to display the result of an experiment, investigation, or inquiry.</h2>
		<h2>For all the reports, HR Schema of Oracle Database is used.</h2>

		<h3>TABULAR REPORT - HR Department Information</h3>
		<h4>A tabular report displays descriptive statistics in a table format. Similar to a spreadsheet, they consist simply of an ordered set of fields in columns, with each matching record listed in a row. A tabular report is the most basic type of report you can build.</h4>

		<h3>MAILING LABEL REPORT - Postal Addresses of HR Department Staff</h3>
		<h4>When you want to use labels to send a bulk mailing to people on your address list, you can use Mailing Label Report to create a sheet of address labels. Each label contains a unique mailing address from your list. So a mailing label report consists of data displayed in a format suitable for use as address labels on envelopes.</h4>

		<h3>FORM LETTER REPORT - Confirmation of Employee Details</h3>
		<h4>When you have bulk mail to send to people on your mailing list, you can use Form Letter report to create a batch of personalized letters. Each letter that is produced has identical layout, formatting text, and graphics. Only specific sections of the letter vary and are personalized. A form letter report is useful for printing multiple copies of the same letter addressed to different people. Form letters are often used as replies from people who get large amount of correspondence, such as celebrities, politicians, etc. Other form letters are used to notify candidates as part of an application process, such as acceptance or rejection letters from publishing companies, governing bodies, colleges, universities or prospective employers. Both the Bush and Obama administration have used form letters to send condolences to the families of killed service members.</h4>

		<h3>MASTER/MASTER REPORT - HR Departments/Employees Job Titles and Salaries</h3>
		<h4>A master/master report is a multiple queries report. These queries are quite unrelated (Although the data may be conceptually related, the queries make no attempt to relate it by the manner in which it is fetched.), but you wish to present the results for each of these queries in the one report. This report contains separate sets of data with no direct links(e.g., no parent/child relationships). Oracle also called it a parent/parent report. This report uses the tabular layout style.</h4>
		<input type="button" value="Click to see report" onclick="openR4()">

		</div>
		
		<div class="R5">	
		<a id="R5">
		<h3>GROUP REPORT - Employees Record</h3>
		<h4>When you are working with relational data (where related data is stored in separate tables), you often need to view information from more than one table or query on the same report. This report uses a default group above layout style in which master records display across the page and the detail records appear below the master reports in standard tabular format.</h4>
		<input type="button" value="Click to see report" onclick="openR5()">
		</a>
		<br>
		</div>
		
		<div class="R6">
		<a id="R6">
		<h3>ACROSS(LEFT TO RIGHT) GROUP REPORT - HR Department Information</h3>
		<h4>An across group report prints the values of a database column across(left to right) the page instead of down. In across reports with breaks, the master (or break) group to the right prints "top to bottom"; that is, as it would in other master/detail reports. However, the values in the detail group print across the page, from left to right. When there are more values than will fit on a line, Oracle Reports wraps the line and prints the remaining values across the page on the next line.</h4>
		<input type="button" value="Click to see report" onclick="openR6()">

		<br>
		</div>
		
		<div class="R7">
		<a id="R7">
		<h3>PAGE TITLE WITH VARIABLE DATA REPORT - Employee Details with respect to Department</h3>
		<h4>Page headers and footers can contain static content, but they are most commonly used to display varying content like page numbers or information about the contents of a page. To display variable data that is different on each page, you must use an expression or query values from the database. </h4>
		<input type="button" value="Click to see report" onclick="openR7()">
		</a>
		<br>
		</div>
		
		<div class="R8">
		<a id="R8">
		<h3>FORMATTED REPORT - Employee Details</h3>
		<h4>In addition to data regions like tables, Oracle Report Builder uses other report items like graphics to add visual interest or highlight key information in the report. Formatting the items in your report makes the report look more attractive and enhances its readability. For example, you can add graphics (line, circle or rectangles), an image to the margin, a title, and a border. You can also change the look of the report by applying different fonts and text styles.</h4>
		<input type="button" value="Click to see report" onclick="openR8()">
		</a>
		<br>
		</div>
		
		<div class="R9">
		<a id="R9">
		<h3>CONDITIONAL TEXTS IN FORM LETTERS - To all Employees from HR Department</h3>
		<h4>Here advanced Report Builder techniques for creating a report with conditional fields that can determine when certain pieces of information should be displayed in your report. Conditional printing is useful when you want to display a section of a report only if certain conditions are met at run time. On the other hand, you may wish to use conditional printing to hide certain information for those who don't need it. This concept is similar to (but more advanced than) mail merge in Microsoft Word.</h4>
		<input type="button" value="Click to see report" onclick="openR9()">

		<br>
		</div>
		
		<div class="R10">
		<a id="R10">
		<h3>MATRIX REPORT - Total Salaries by Job Function and Department</h3>
		<h4>A matrix report looks like a grid. It contains one row of labels, one column of labels, and information in a grid format that is related to both the row and column labels. While the terms "matrix" and "table" can be used interchangeably, tables generally have a fixed number of rows and columns, while the size of a matrix may change dynamically.</h4>
		<h4>Matrix reports are similar to summary reports but allow you to group and summarize data by rows and columns. The number of rows and columns for groups is determined by the number of unique values for each row and column groups. Use a matrix to display aggregated data summaries, grouped in rows and columns. You can also use this type for comparing related totals, especially if you have large amounts of data to summarize and you need to compare values in several different fields, or you want to look at data by date and by product, person, or geography.</h4>
